Welcome to the repository for Running Balance
================================================

This app is a product whose initial engineering I have made open source. In fact, you can see this code in action at [Running Balance OSS on Heroku](http://running-balance-oss.herokuapp.com/).

What this app is
==============================================

This app is meant to evolve into some lightweight way to keep track of how much money you have in various bank accounts. It will also, at some point, feature a mobile version (some of the infrastructure for which I have laid down already).

What this app is not
================================================

Parts of this application have been open-sourced, for portfolio reasons. However, as development of this app progresses, further progress on the project may not be open sourced.

Setting it up on your machine
================================================

This is a normal Rails 3 app. `bundle install` etc etc is your friend

Where can I find out more information?
================================================

The website has good about documentation
